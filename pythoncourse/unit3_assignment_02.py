For this assignment, you have to define a few basic classes to get an idea of definining your own types.

# For this problem, define a iterator class called Repeater which can be used to  generate an infinite
# sequence of this form: 1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 3, etc. (for each number N is repeated N times with opposing signs).
# Use the class instance state to keep track of the iteration state. Do not allocate large amounts of memory :)!
# Refer to: https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types
